# Leukemia

Oncological images loading and pre-processing (blurring, thresholding, cropping).
Feature extraction using pre-trained CNNs (VGG19) and pre-trained Residual CNN (ResNet50, ResNet101).
Feature localization using Scale Invariant Features Transformation (SIFT).
Feature normalization using min-max scaling.
Feature selection using ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Random Forest Feature Selection, Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Comparing binary classifiers: k-Neighbors, (Gaussian) Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Model selection: Hypothesis Test, Grid Search and Stratified k-fold Cross Validation
Classifiers should distinguish between healthy blood cells and sick blood cells (acute lymphoblastic leukemia)
